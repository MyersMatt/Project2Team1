TA Instruments Discovery Differential Scanning Calorimeter DSC 25P
The DSC 25P is a dedicated Pressure DSC module that provides heat flow measurements on pressure sensitive materials. The Discovery DSC 25P is used to study thermal transitions, chemical reactions and oxidative stability/ decomposition under vacuum, standard atmospheric pressure and elevated pressures. It measures a materials’ heat flow in a variety of inert, oxidizing or reducing atmospheres. The DSC 25P has a pressure range of 1 Pa to 7 MPa (0.0001 to 1,000 psi) of which experiments can be performed under static or dynamic purge (constant volume or constant pressure).  The Discovery DSC 25P can operate under atmospheric and elevated pressures from ambient to 550 °C. The optional Quench Cooling Accessory for the FACS extends the operational temperature range of the DSC 25P down to -130°C.
