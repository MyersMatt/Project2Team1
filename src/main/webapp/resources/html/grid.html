            <details class="prod-desc">XGT-9000 Combines New Imaging Technology with High Sensitivity for High-Speed
                Analysis of Foreign Materials in one Instrument. HORIBA Scientific, a global leader in spectroscopy
                instrumentation and solutions, announces the release of its new XGT-9000 X-ray analytical microscope
                (μXRF), which simultaneously performs elemental analysis and optical observation of samples without
                destroying or contacting them. Incorporating HORIBA’s proprietary X-ray technology, with the highest
                resolution in the world, the XGT-9000 not only screens foreign objects that often cause problems in the
                production process of lithium-ion batteries, food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals but also analyzes
                elements in semiconductor integrated circuits and other micro-objects. It also measures film thickness
                and adherence amounts with a high degree of accuracy.
